# Introduction

This is the repository I kept for Hong Kong University of Science and Technology's Coursera Course on Node.js found [here](https://www.coursera.org/learn/server-side-nodejs). Although I audited this course, and thus do not have the certificate, I gained valuable knowledge concerning the fundamental principles involved in the development of REST API's utilizing Node.js and Express.js.
